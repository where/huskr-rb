Deployment:

* Initially run heroku create.  If the gem is installed, and your credentials are configured it will create a new app for you.
* Then run git push heroku master, after commiting.  This will deploy your code to the heroku stack.
* Since we have a database migration, we need to run that after deploying.  This can be done by running `heroku run "rake db:migrate"`.

Additional Considerations:
* It often makes sense to add API credentials, to validate that the requester is allowed to access the given resource.
